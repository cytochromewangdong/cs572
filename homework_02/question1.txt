Answer 1:
setTimeout schedules a script to be run after a minimum threshold in ms has elapsed, it takes two parameters, the first parameter is the callback function, the second parameter is the time for the delay for the callback to be executed. The callback is put in the Timer Queue.
setImmediate is designed to execute a script once the current poll queue(incoming connection,data) phase completes, it takes only one parameter: the callback function which is put in the Check queque.
When the delay is zero, the behavior of setImmediate is similar to setTimeout(,0), we should use setImmediate because it is more brief and readable. However in the browser, there is not setImmediate function, we have to use setTimeout(,0). 
When the delya is great than zero, it means we need some delay for our cases, we should use setTimeout.

Answer 2:
Both process.nextTick and setImmediate both accept a callback function, but the process.nextTick puts the callback in the main queque and the system executes the callback before the eventloop continues. The setImmediate put the callback function in the Check queque and the system executes the callback function in the eventloop. It means: process.nextTick executes the callback function earlier than setImmediate.
